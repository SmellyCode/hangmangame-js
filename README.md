Classic guessing game implemented 100% in JavaScript (1 Player vs Computer).

By now, the game is based on "Fruit" words but some enhancements are expected for future versions.

# Live demo:
Can be found @ http://jsfiddle.net/oscarj24/97r1n2ct/

# Possible enhancements for v2.0:

1. Add a "Hint" button for helping the player during a game.
2. Add word categories and make the player capable to select one when starting a game.
3. Add a timer for each game to know how much time lacks the player before receiving a "Game Over".
4. Add scores to the game (Max. score calculation could depend on how fast the player finishes a game without hints).
5. Add sounds to the game.
6. Improve buttons style and add effects to the game (jQuery animate and effects like fadeIn/fadeOut or explode are some ideas).

# Note:
This is a 100% JavaScript game and more complexity could be added but that will make it use server side and a database which is not the idea.
