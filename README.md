# Hangman Game JS v1.0
Classic guessing game implemented *100%* in `JavaScript` *(1 Player vs Computer)*. By now, the game is based on *"Fruit"* words but some enhancements are expected for a future version.

### Live demo
- Can be found @ [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/oscarj24/97r1n2ct/)
- [Rawgit](http://rawgit.com/) may be useful for including new scripts to the current implementation.

### Possible enhancements for v2.0 and further

- Add a "Hint" button for helping the player during a game.
- Add word categories and make the player capable to select one when starting a game.
- Add a timer for each game to know how much time lacks the player before receiving a "Game Over".
- Add scores to the game (Max. score calculation could depend on how fast the player finishes a game without hints).
- Add sounds to the game.
- Add game settings like "Sound On/Off" and word complexity like "5-10 characters" (Use `cookies` to achieve this).
- Improve buttons style and add effects to the game (`jQuery` animate and effects like "explode" are some ideas).
- Generate a minified version of the script(s).

### Note
This is a *100%* `JavaScript` game and I know more features could be added but that will involve a whole refactor, use server side and a database which is **NOT** aligned to the original idea.
