# Hangman Game JS v1.0
Classic guessing game implemented 100% in JavaScript (1 Player vs Computer). By now, the game is based on "Fruit" words but some enhancements are expected for a future version.

# Live demo
- Can be found @ JSFiddle: http://bitly.com/1BhC6Vt
- Rawgit (http://rawgit.com/) may be useful for including scripts.

# Possible enhancements for v2.0 and further

1. Add a "Hint" button for helping the player during a game.
2. Add word categories and make the player capable to select one when starting a game.
3. Add a timer for each game to know how much time lacks the player before receiving a "Game Over".
4. Add scores to the game (Max. score calculation could depend on how fast the player finishes a game without hints).
5. Add sounds to the game.
6. Add game settings like "Sound On/Off" and word complexity like "5-10 characters" (Use cookies to achieve this).
6. Improve buttons style and add effects to the game (jQuery animate and effects like "explode" are some ideas).
7. Generate a minified version of the scripts.

# Note
This is a 100% JavaScript game and I know more features could be added but that will involve a whole refactor, use server side and a database which is not aligned to the original idea.
