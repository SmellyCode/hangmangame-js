#### Live demo
- Can be found [here](http://jsfiddle.net/oscarj24/45zpg42w/embedded/result/)
- [Rawgit](http://rawgit.com/) may be useful for including new scripts to the current implementation.

#### Possible enhancements for v2.0 and further

- Add a *"Hint"* button for helping a player during the game.
- Add word categories and make a player capable to select one when starting the game.
- Add a timer for each game to know how much time is pending before a player gets a *"Game Over"*.
- Add scores to the game *(Score calculation could depend on how fast the player finishes a game without hints)*.
- Add sound effects to the game.
- Add game settings like *"Sound On/Off"* and word complexity like *"5-10 characters" (Use `cookies` to achieve this)*.
- Improve buttons style and add effects to the game *(`jQuery` animate and effects like "explode" are some ideas)*.
- Improve game design.
- Minify scripts.
